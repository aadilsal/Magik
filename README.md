# Magik Programming Language

## Introduction

Welcome to **Magik** — a lightweight and imaginative programming language designed to feel like spellcasting! With Magik, you write code not just to execute functions, but to craft **incantations** that invoke the magic of computation. Built on top of LLVM, Magik reimagines traditional programming constructs into magical metaphors, providing a unique, minimalistic, and enchanting programming experience.

Our goal is to offer a programming language that is intuitive, expressive, and fun, while retaining essential functionality for modern development.

## Features

Magik incorporates the core features of modern programming languages but presents them with a mystical twist:

### Variable Binding
Magik allows you to bind variables using a colon-based assignment:
myvariable: 50

### Output Spell
To display output on the screen, you cast a reveal spell
reveal("Magic activated!")

### Conditionals
Magik uses the cast when keyword for conditional logic:
cast when myvariable > 30:
  reveal("Power surge!")

### Looping
Loops in Magik are represented by the whirl keyword, allowing you to iterate over a range:
whirl i from 0...5:
  reveal(i)


### Comments
Comments in Magik are written as quiet whispers, indicated by ~~:
~~ this multiplies the number

### Additional Features
Beyond its basic constructs, Magik emphasizes expressive minimalism:

Statements read like a story or a spell, making the code feel more like a magical narrative.

Brackets are used sparingly, with whitespace and structure guiding readability.

Creativity is encouraged in naming and using constructs.

Optional extension: Users can define custom magical keywords (e.g., summon, enchant, invoke) to add their own flair to the language.

### Conclusion
Magik is more than just a programming language — it's an experience. With simplicity, originality, and charm at its core, Magik provides a fresh perspective on how programming can be a creative, magical journey.
