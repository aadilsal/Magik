A novel programming language: Ace / Magik / Myst  
Introduction 
We propose the creation of Magik, a lightweight, imaginative programming language designed 
to feel like spellcasting. Built using LLVM, Magik reimagines traditional programming 
constructs as incantations — making code not just functional, but enchanting. The goal is to 
provide a unique yet minimal language that includes basic control structures while remaining 
distinct from typical syntactic conventions. 
Features 
Magik supports the essentials of modern programming, wrapped in magical metaphors: 
Variable Binding 
Bind variables using a simple colon-based assignment. 
myvariable: 50  
Output Spell: reveal(...) 
To show output to the screen. 
reveal("Magic activated!")   
Conditionals: cast when ...: 
For branching logic. 
cast when myvariable> 30:   
reveal("Power surge!")   
Looping: whirl i from 0...n: 
Elegant looping using range-like notation. 
whirl i from 0...5:   
reveal(i)   
Functions: conjure, unveil 
Define reusable spells (functions) and return values. 
 
 
 conjure double(x):   
    unveil x * 2   
Comments: ~~ 
 Annotate the spellbook with quiet whispers. 
 
 ~~ this multiplies the number   
Additional Feature: Expressive Minimalism 
Beyond its standard constructs, Magik prioritizes expressiveness over conformity: 
● Every statement reads like a story or a spell. 
 
● Brackets are used sparingly; whitespace and structure keep things readable. 
 
● Encourages creativity in naming and usage. 
 
● Optional: Users may extend the language to include magical domain-specific keywords 
(e.g., summon, enchant, invoke) for customized flair. 
Conclusion 
Magik is designed for simplicity, originality, and charm. With only two weeks, our team of three 
aims to implement: 
● A working lexer and parser using LLVM 
 
● A functioning compiler backend 
 
● Support for all the finalized language constructs 
 
● Sample programs demonstrating Magik’s syntax 
 
Magik is more than a language — it's an experience.
